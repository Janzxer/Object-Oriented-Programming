* Objects  *
************

Attributes are sometimes called as variables, properties or fields.
Though for example a property is a bit different than an attribute

Attributes are quite like the variables.

Object can have attributes like:

Fiat object attributes:
speed = 80
numberOfDoors = 4

Objects can do something, for example change the values of its attributes. These procedures/actions/behaviors are called methods.

Fiat object methods:
Accelerate
Start

Object is like a part og a machine for example a dishwasher

Every object has a role:

Object 1 knows everything
Object 2 validates the data
Object 3 prints

************
*   Class  *
************

Every object is an instance of a class.

Class itself is nothing, class is a blueprint more of a blueprint for creating objects.

Class defines common attributes and methods of an object.

From class objects can be created.

********************
*   Class diagram  *
********************

When planning a class it's good to make a class diagram to set the initial idea for what the class does.

The diagram is made of 3 parts: Name of the class, attributes of the class and the methods of the class.

In the first box we have the name of the class, and it starts with the uppercase letter and usually it is centered.
The attributes of the class goes in the second box and start with a lowercase letter.
The methods go in the third box and in Java methods also start with lowercase letter, but for example in C# the methods start with uppercase letter.
